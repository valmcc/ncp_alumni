title: Malaysia
country_description: >-
  A multi-ethnic and multi-cultural country, with most people being Malay, but
  there are also Chinese and Indians. This leads to a wide variety of cuisine.
  The official language is Malay written in the Latin alphabet. English is a
  recognised language. Tamil and Chinese are also often used. There are over 130
  other languages spoken in Malaysia, with 94 in Malaysian Borneo and 40 on the
  peninsula. Islam is the official religion, but non-Malay citizens have the
  freedom to practice other religions.

          A tasty and staple food that you can find at many small (mostly
          Chinese) restuarants but also on campus at University Malaya. It
          usually costs around 5 ringgit (about $1.50 AUD - what a bargain!) and
          is very filling. It typically comes with a small bowl of kuah (soup)
          that you can add to the rice if it is too dry.

        heading: How to find accommodation
        text: >-
          Finding accommodation in Malaysia isn't too difficult but we'd advise
          you to wait until you get there before choosing a place to settle
          permanently. Places may look different to how they do in the country
          and it might be different than it appears online.  


          There's a few options when it comes to choosing accommodation:


          * Facebook: it may sound strange but some of the NCPers who ended up
          with the best deals found accommodation through facebook groups. Lots
          of expats join private facebook pages and with internationals
          coming/going constantly there are many nice apartments with available
          rooms (around 1000-1500 MYR)

          * Ibilik: Malaysia's version of Airbnb. It tends to have a whole range
          of prices/types of accommodation but isn't as user friendly as some of
          the other options. We also found it to be a bit racists (e.g.
          properties will specify the type of racial background they want the
          tenant to have).

          * Airbnb: I'm sure you're all familiar with this one! Quite a few
          options but they do tend to be a bit more pricey than ibilik.

          * University accommodation: mixed reviews. This can be very cheap,
          very convenient and a good way to make friends. However, it can also
          be run down, dirty and not very comfortable (no air-con which kinda a
          big tie-breaker). Plus there's certain rules you'll need to be
          prepared to abide to (no alcohol or pork in the dorms, curfew times,
          no boys in girls rooms and vice versa). If you're studying at the
          University of Malaya (Universiti Malaya) try get into International
          House (IH). IH is a bunch of fairly new apartments built just off
          campus and doesn't have any of the rules that the on-campus dorms
          have. You can live with whoever you want and it's very convenient and
          pretty modern (and yes there is aircon!).

          It's pretty standard practice that you will be required to pay a
          bond/safety deposit before moving in. This generally tends to be the
          equivalent of 1-2 months rent, depending on your landlord/lady.
          However, it's also very common for it to be incredibly difficult to
          get your bond back. This tends to happen to internationals and as it's
          generally around the time you're heading back home/moving on a lot of
          people in this situation never get their bond back. TIP: ask your
          landlord/lady if instead of paying your final month/two month's rent
          you can forgo your deposit.
