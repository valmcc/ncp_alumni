title: Malaysia
country_description: >-
  A multi-ethnic and multi-cultural country, with most people being Malay, but
  there are also Chinese and Indians. This leads to a wide variety of cuisine.
  The official language is Malay written in the Latin alphabet. English is a
  recognised language. Tamil and Chinese are also often used. There are over 130
  other languages spoken in Malaysia, with 94 in Malaysian Borneo and 40 on the
  peninsula. Islam is the official religion, but non-Malay citizens have the
  freedom to practice other religions.

        heading: How to find accommodation
        text: >-
          Finding accommodation in Malaysia isn't too difficult but we'd advise
          you to wait until you get there before choosing a place to settle
          permanently. Places may look different to how they do in the country
          and it might be different than it appears online.  


          There's a few options when it comes to choosing accommodation:


          * **Facebook:** it may sound strange but some of the NCPers who ended
          up with the best deals found accommodation through facebook groups.
          Lots of expats join private facebook pages and with internationals
          coming/going constantly there are many nice apartments with available
          rooms (around 1000-1500 MYR)

          * **Ibilik:** Malaysia's version of Airbnb. It tends to have a whole
          range of prices/types of accommodation but isn't as user friendly as
          some of the other options. We also found it to be a bit racists (e.g.
          properties will specify the type of racial background they want the
          tenant to have).

          * **Airbnb:** I'm sure you're all familiar with this one! Quite a few
          options but they do tend to be a bit more pricey than ibilik.

          * **University accommodation:** mixed reviews. This can be very cheap,
          very convenient and a good way to make friends. However, it can also
          be run down, dirty and not very comfortable (no air-con which kinda a
          big tie-breaker). Plus there's certain rules you'll need to be
          prepared to abide to (no alcohol or pork in the dorms, curfew times,
          no boys in girls rooms and vice versa). If you're studying at the
          University of Malaya (Universiti Malaya) try get into International
          House (IH). IH is a bunch of fairly new apartments built just off
          campus and doesn't have any of the rules that the on-campus dorms
          have. You can live with whoever you want and it's very convenient and
          pretty modern (and yes there is aircon!).

        text: >-
          It's pretty standard practice that you will be required to pay a
          bond/safety deposit before moving in. This generally tends to be the
          equivalent of 1-2 months rent, depending on your landlord/lady.
          However, it's also very common for it to be incredibly difficult to
          get your bond back. This tends to happen to internationals and as it's
          generally around the time you're heading back home/moving on a lot of
          people in this situation never get their bond back. TIP: ask your
          landlord/lady if instead of paying your final month/two month's rent
          you can forgo your deposit.

        heading: A Guide to Kuala Lumpur's Music Scene
        text: >-
          This is a brief guide to music events around Kuala Lumpur. There are a
          surprising amount of big artists visiting KL due to it being quite
          central to the Asian region ~ and a lot of the shows are quite cheap,
          and don't even sell out!! There is more to add here, but consider this
          a brief intro.


          ## Good Vibes Music Festival


          ![Good vibes logo](/img/good vibes.jpg)


          Located in Genting Highlands, north of KL, this festival usually has a
          surprisingly good lineup for such a low price (tickets are usually
          ~$40 AUD). You can get a package to stay at the hotel on the top of
          the mountatin (First World Hotel) and take the gondola down to the
          festival ground. We went in 2016 and saw Disclosure, Two Door Cinema
          Club, Ryan Hemsworth, Purity Ring, and noticed that the crowd was
          super respectful and friendly. Unfortunately an un-named scholar I
          went with left her phone and didn't find it again, losing all of our
          photos of this event. Despite this, would recommend. 


          ## Tiger Uncaged


          ![CHVRCHES](/img/tiger uncaged.jpg)


          Tiger is a beer company, and to promote their product they have a few
          events/festivals around KL. I got to attend a free CHVRCHES concert on
          the TREC carpark via one of their contests on their Facebook page.
          I've checked out some of their food events also, (you can usually get
          invited by commenting to a post on their Facebook page) and they
          generally have some pretty cool stuff set up eg. free spray paint or
          water guns filled with UV paint with free-paint walls in the carpark.


          ![ncp throwie](/img/ncp graf.jpg)


          _Some say that evidence of the New Colombo Plan in Malaysia still
          exists on the walls of the TREC car park_


          ## Red Bull Music Academy


          ![Hanging out with
          BADBADNOTGOOD](/img/15233775_1168054999930068_1199554881_o.jpg)


          _Photo: Hanging out with BADBADNOTGOOD_


          This is an initiative by Red Bull to try to connect local artists with
          international acts to try to improve the local scene. They advertise
          free producer meetups that you can go to and talk to a lot of
          international talent (and get free tix to their shows!) Would
          recommend if you are into music production. Also they run cheap shows
          with local and international acts around the city (usually at Le Noir
          or Urbanscapes House). I met some awesome artists and people through
          these (BADBADNOTGOOD, Phon.O, the 50 weapons record label guys, the
          bouncer from Berghain etc.)


          ## Urbanscapes Festival


          Unfortunately I wasn't here for this, but I have heard good things!!

        heading: Chicken Rice
        imageurl: /img/chicken_rice_malaysia.jpg
        text: >-
          A tasty and staple food that you can find at many small (mostly
          Chinese) restuarants but also on campus at University Malaya. It
          usually costs around 5 ringgit (about $1.50 AUD - what a bargain!) and
          is very filling. It typically comes with a small bowl of kuah (soup)
          that you can add to the rice if it is too dry.
