        text: >-
          A tasty and staple food that you can find at many small (mostly
          Chinese) restuarants but also on campus at University Malaya. It
          usually costs around 5 ringgit (about $1.50 AUD - what a bargain!) and
          is very filling. It typically comes with a small bowl of kuah (soup)
          that you can add to the rice if it is too dry.
