<h2>Brief Guide to Adding Content</h2>

<p>You can add content by accessing the admin page here: <a href="http://ncp.netlify.com/admin">http://ncp.netlify.com/admin</a> and logging in with your email and password.</p>

<p>A few general notes: <li>
	Try to make sure that images aren't too big (try to keep them under 500 KB)
</li>
<li>
	The preview is a bit slow to update (especially with images) - I recommend turning it off (the little eye icon)
</li>
<li>
	Try to not post anything too controversial
</li>
<li>
	Don't delete/modify other people's contributions - if this does happen I'm making constant backups of every change, so easy to fix
</li>
<li>
	Have fun!
</li></p>
<p>Eventually when there's enough content on here I'll go about getting a proper website name, etc. - but it's still a work in progress!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
